              A curse hangs over the small, foggy Japanese coastal town of
              Kurozu-cho. According to Kirie Goshima&apos;s withdrawn boyfriend
              Shuichi Saito, the town is haunted not by a person or creature but
              by the pattern uzumaki. A spiral and hypnotic secret form of the

              in the sea and to the human body. As the anxiety spreads, the

              endless maelstrom…

              A curse hangs over the small, foggy Japanese coastal town of
              Kurozu-cho. According to Kirie Goshima&apos;s withdrawn boyfriend
              Shuichi Saito, the town is haunted not by a person or creature but
              by the pattern uzumaki. A spiral and hypnotic secret form of the
              world that manifests in everything. From seashells to maelstroms
              in the sea and to the human body. As the anxiety spreads, the
              inhabitants of Kurozu-cho are drawn deeper and deeper into the
              endless maelstrom…
